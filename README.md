# Malaria_Tracker

This platform is presented as a visual support to my master thesis to quantify and visualize the main parameters of bet net use, 
access and ownership analysed in malaria control surveys. To do so, I use data from Demographic and Health Surveys for the last 
ten years and for a wide set of Sub-Saharan African countries. It also includes some contextual variables like malaria funding or malaria incidence.

In order to run the application, please download the input files from here:
